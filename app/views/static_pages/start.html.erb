<p>Every year hundreds of letters come pouring into the post office in Verona, Italy – all with one person in mind. They are all addressed to Juliet – the fictional heroine of William Shakespeare’s renowned play “Romeo and Juliet.” And each and every one of these letters are painstakingly read and answered by a group of ladies (and some gentlemen) who are known as the “Juliet Club.

And what are in these letters? Pleas to the one woman in the world who knows a thing or two about unrequited love – Juliet herself.
